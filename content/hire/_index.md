Before dropping me a message, I would love you to read about my workflow.

## 1. Who Am I
In a practice, I'm somebody who makes a living by creating and optimizing solutions, in order to help people. Pure and simply, I'm a builder. Like Manny or Bob (but I write code). I may be a little bit difficult to get along with, if you don't
agree that __**remote work**__ and __**flexible working hours**__ are the next big thing. However, I try to keep my availability up to 24/7 and flexible to everyone.

## 2. Flexiblity and Results Oriented
I like being my own boss (or my own supervisor) in a way that I don't care how many hours I work, from 9-5 or from 10-6. **Results are results** and I always push my projects to go beyond expectations both in terms of performance, speed and efficency.

## 3. No F*#@ing Around. Your business matters to me.
I don't like bottlenecks or wasted time. Good engineering means great developer and client  experience, not forgetting good pay. It's very frustrating whenever someone brings useless tech stacks discussions to the table. I try to put myself in the business owner's foot all the time. Business is key, even if costs have to be sacrificed for better results and profits.

## 4. Never compromise performance due to budget
I love building software from scratch if that means the performance will be greater. Great tech solutions empower businesses to perform way better, than cheaper but slower tech.

## 4. Blazing fast prototyping and customer commitment
If we agree about a budget, project deadline and specs I expect you, as a client, to be commited to the idea and avoid wasting time with useless discussions. This way, the product gets delivered sooner than you realise.
