## Who Am I
In a practice, I'm somebody who makes a living by creating and optimizing solutions, in order to help people. Pure and simply, I'm a builder. Like Manny or Bob (but I write code, haha). I may be a little bit difficult to get along with, if you don't
agree that **remote** and __**flexible schedules**__ are the next big thing.

## Flexible  and Results Oriented
I like being my own boss (or my own supervisor) in a way that I don't care how many hours I work, from 9-5 or from 10-6. **Results are results** and I always push my projects to go beyond expectations both in terms of performance, speed and efficency.

## No F*#@ing Around
I don't like bottlenecks or wasted time. Good engineering means great developer (and client) experience, not forgetting good pay. It's very frustrating whenever someone brings useless tech stacks discussions to the table. I try to put myself in the business owner's foot all the time.
