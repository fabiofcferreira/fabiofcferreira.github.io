On March of 2020, I joined a group of 14 other developers from different companies and startups in the Portuguese ecosystem to develop an MVP in less than 8 days to track people with COVID-19.
\
\
I ended up working on the frontend (Angular 9), mainly. Even though the bureocracy in Portugal is absolutely ridiculous and the fact that the national health administration institution refused to use our web application to keep track of people with COVID-19 and at the same time help the medical staff, we passed the 38K users mark under only 5 days after the beta launch.
\
\
The webapp is publicly accessible with Facebook login at https://covidografia.pt

Here's a look into the MVP we released in late March 2020, as our beta release:
