Creating technology and having fun while doing it is my job. I take a lot of pleasure in deploying the applications and websites I've helped build. It means the world to me when I see an ambitious project has been published and I am always proud to only associate with projects I really believe.

The world is full of opportunities specially in this era of the internet. Yet, dedicating your energy and skillset to the things you really stand for is exciting and can surprise you.
