I first met Malik Piara, a young dreamer, back when I was 15 (August, 2016). Ever since, we've developed many projects in and out of Upframe. It all began as a pre-acceleration programme at Upframe.
\
\
That was my very first serious website I've developed. It took the small team of 3 people - 2 developers (me and [@hacdias](https://hacdias.com)) and 1 designer ([@juauz](https://juauz.com)) - only two weeks to design and develop the entire website.
\
\
The website use case was to present and explain the **pre-acceleration programme** organisation. We had a handful of amazing mentors who sat with the group of (around) 10 people to teach them about a certain matter. It ranged from Collaborative Design to Business Models and Sales. More than half of these participants have businesses running as of today, 31st of December 2020 but most importantly, they were changed by this programme.
\
\
The tech stack was composed by:
- Hugo
- Node.JS (Gulp)
- Markdown

\
Despite the pre-acceleration programme being adopted by Startup Lisboa, only to become the in-house mentorship programme, we soon realised our technological power was beyond Portugal's standards.
\
\
After months of thinking and self-development we concluded there was (and still is) a lack of mentorship to the promising ecosystem to develop a mentorship platform from scratch. The tech stack used was:
- Node.JS (Express and MySQL)
- React
\
\
I led the development of the platform until December 2019, point at which I left. It was due to the desire to focus on freelancing and personal development, such as university degree.
