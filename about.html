        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hey! What's up?
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I am <b>Fábio Ferreira</b> and I am a full-stack self-taught programmer, 15 years old and I live in Braga, Portugal.</p>

        <h2>My interests and goals</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, <b>I hate school but love learning.</b><br>

          In my opinion, Portugal's educational system isn't good because:<br>
            - All students are being evaluated equally;<br>
            - College access depends on subjects that you don't need for your course.<br>
            - Classes are too big (90 minute block and then 10-15 minute break).<br>
        </p><br>
        <p>However, I am very curious about everything, not only programming but also Maths, Physics, Biology and Philosophy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love people. Specially, those who wish to change the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          One of my biggest goals is to build a team of intelligent, curious
          and loving entrepreneurs and develop new ideas, new products and change the world.
        </p>
        <h2>So, when and how did it all start?</h2>
        <p>
          I was 3 years old when I used a computer for the first time.
          Those "rocks" with B&W screens.<br>
          But my passion for programming and design were born when my godfather started talking about
          some friends he had that wrote software. I was kinda curious about
          how it was done. This was back in 2012 when I was only 11 years old.<br><br>
          I spent some days googling about programming and I "discovered" VB.net.
          I started watching some tutorials on YouTube (on my free time).
          And in July of 2014 I bought my first programming book (Visual Basic programming book) which I read in 2 weeks.<br><br>
          In September/October of 2014 I googled about websites to learn programming.
          I found Codecademy and learned PHP, JavaScript, Python and HTML/CSS.
          Since then I've been reading free eBooks and practising my programming skills.
        </p>

        <h2>In the end...</h2>
        <p>
          I just want to change the world with a very good workgroup.
          My biggest wish is to improve people's lives.
